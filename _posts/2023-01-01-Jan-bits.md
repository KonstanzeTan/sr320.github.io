Trying to get to SBA again for E5. Will write nrsp8 report on ferry, compile bow tie info at airport with an eye towards ceabigr.

January 10 at 9:39 PM

Tomorrow I want to try to see what it would involve to try to get images in these January bit post meaning how easy is it to write mark down on the phone inside of my Working Copy app? ðŸ˜Š

January 10 2:32 PM

Submitted Oly paper. Queried Daniel on ecology search tactics. Working more on class website; should be done with week 3, just need to confirm with Ariana.

January 10 10:16 AM

Trip to SBA cancelled - will go tomorrow. Might try to record presentation to save time tomorrow. Worked on class website in Rstudio - still a bit of mystery but getting it done. Have faculty meeting today to discuss hiring rubric. Also plan on finishing up revisions on Oly epigenetics paper.

Also need to write NRSP8 summary.

January 9 11:31 AM

Today I was working on the website for my class using our studio and one thing I learned is that for some pages you actually have to knit and build the website and also I noticed that in our markdown file there is an option that every time you say they are marked down it will automatically net so I selected that and that should save me a time

January 6 2:56 PM

I just figured out how to use Shortcuts on an Apple iPhone such that at a given time every day my monthly post will come up on my phone automatically I update it and hit commit and done

January 6, 1:51 PM

OK now I just canâ€™t resist posting to my notebook because itâ€™s so easy ðŸ˜Š

January 6 1:32 PM.

I have completed my objective of making this easy. I have an icon on the home on my phone I click on it brings up a text page and I talk to my phone.

January 6 1:18 PM

What I have done now is set up the infrastructure to make notebook post on a daily basis using my phone and using my voice leveraging the application called Working Copy. I could also use the native GitHub application on my phone but this has a few advantages .
