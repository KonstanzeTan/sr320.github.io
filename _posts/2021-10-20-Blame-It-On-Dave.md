What an awesome first experience at Climate Pledge Arena!

Now, back to business. After lab meeting yesterday I spent some time thinking about the geographic regions (that house charismatic organisms) that may have enough ecotox data to support a historical review of the environment and marine organisms before and after toxic event. For example, we know the Gulf of Mexico has been subjected to acute and chronic toxicity events. What environments (mangroves, seagrasses, shoreline sediments, etc.) have been altered and what are those alterations? This is not a new question by any means, but it does help me to determine what fields are over saturated- which I can learn from, and which are underrepresented.
