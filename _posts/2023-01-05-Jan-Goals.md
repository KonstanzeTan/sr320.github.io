My January goal is to try to make posting to my notebook easier. I would also like to get a better handle at project management. 

January 6
are you telling me that all I had to do this entire time was opening up the get up app open the file OK maybe I'll type the date January 6, and then I don't even have to type anymore. All I have to do is record a message or I guess another way to phrase that is use speech to text to make a notebook post , this is a game changer!
